# Allthingspastor
A database for all things a pastor needs in a day at the touch of a button

I would just love to create a one-stop database that includes all things a pastor needs to do his job, including a place to describe details about the church building I serve, the staff, a database of contacts which includes members, funeral homes, businesses I work with, cemetery records, appointment schedules, daily operations, sermon preperation, Classes I teach, just to name a few elements.
